# Analysis report of social media tweets for Acme-Blammo-XYZ Co.
## Report objectives
Acme-Blammo-XYZ Co. want to analyse the user engagement generated by the tweets they post to their social media site. They aim to improve their social media perfomance using the reults of this analysis.

They require a python script that will produce an analysis of the logged data from their tweets. This script should split the data into pre-defined categories. The management team can then use that analysis to plan how to improve user engagement in the various categories.

## Description of the source data
As this is an initial, pre-production service the data is to be randomly generated, in the same format as live production data. This allows the team to develop the methods used in this analysis without risking causing an outage on the production service.

As the data is randomly generated, it is not subject to any ownership or data privacy concerns.

The data is evaluated by the ROCC metric [Reliability, Originality, Comprehension, Current, Cited], as follows:
- Reliability: Good - the project requires that the data to be used is randomly generated. As such, the data comes from a 'first order' sourse and so can be considered to be highly reliable
-  Originality: Good - as the data is generated for the project, it is original
-  Comprehension: Good - the script generates data only for the topics required so the data that is created covers the whole set of candidate topics
-  Current: Good - the script sets the date for the data that is generated so it can be considered to be 'Current'
-  Cited: Poor - as the data is unique to this project it is not quoted in any external sources, beyond this report

## Methods
The raw engagement data is to be turned into a Pandas dataframe. The script follows these steps in the analysis:
- after the Pandas dataframe is created the top five entries are displayed to show that the data has been imported correctly
```
## Import Twitter data into a pandas DataFrame and show the top 5 lines
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df.head(5))
```

- following that, any null data fields are dropped from the dataframe and any duplicated enties are also dropped from the dataframe
```
# Task 4 â€“ Clean the data
# Remove all the null data and any duplicate entries
df.dropna(inplace=True)
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
```

- date entries are caste into DateTime format, and the 'Likes' category data is caste as integers. This is to enforce consistency in the data entries for later analysis
```
###Caste the 'Date' value into datetime format
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

## Caste all 'Likes' values as integer
df = df.astype({"Likes": int})
```

- create a chart of the user engagement data
```
## Set a visual theme, and display the data graphically
sns.set_theme()
sns.boxplot(x=df['Category'], y=df['Likes'])
plt.show()
```

- produce a text output of the mean value of all 'Likes' across all categories
```
## Find the mean value for the 'Likes' column
meanlist = df["Likes"].tolist()
print(f"Likes mean val: {sum(meanlist)/len(meanlist)}")
```

- the last stage is to produce a text report of the mean values for engagemnts in each category

## Analysis output
The initial run of the script produced the following image:

## Improvements
The main change to this process should be to use actual user engagement data, rather than randomly generated data. The average mean value for all categories is calcuted and reported. It would be more useful if it was displayed on the chart.

## Results
From the chart output it can be noted that all categories were receiving user engagements of between approximately 1500 and 9000 'Likes'. This suggests a wide range in the levels of user engagement between the various categories. By looking at the mean values of the categories we can see:
- the 'Fashion', 'Culture' and 'Travel' categories have the lowest mean values
- the 'Fashion', 'Culture' and 'Health' categories have the lowest overall levels of engagement
- the 'Fitness', 'Food' and 'Family' categories have the highest overall level of engagement

## Recommendations
The Fashion and Culture categories have the lowest overall, and lowest mean levels of user engagement. These are the poorest performing categories. Management should look at how they could improve user engagement in those categories.
